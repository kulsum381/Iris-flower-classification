# Iris-flower-classification
 I built this project to classify Iris flower species using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model building with k-NN, SVM, and Logistic Regression. Libraries used: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Models were evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix.
